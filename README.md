Welcome to the Connect4 AI Model! 

## Introduction

This Connect4 Game project is a modern take on the classic Connect4 game. This project started as a class assignment written in ReasonML, where players could compete against an AI model in the terminal. It has since been converted into a full-stack application with a modern UI.  The frontend is built using TypeScript and React. The backend algorithm has been rewritten in Python and is hosted on a Flask server, with Firebase managing the records (Wins/Losses/Draws).

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Seamless Connect4 game experience with a responsive UI.
- **AI Opponent**: AI opponent powered by Python using a minimax and estimateValue algorithm.
- **Game History**: Tracks AI game history and performance.

## Tech Stack
