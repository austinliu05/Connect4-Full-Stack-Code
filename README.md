# Connect4 Game

Welcome to the Connect4 AI Model! This project started as a class assignment written in ReasonML, where players could compete against an AI model in the terminal. It has since been converted to Python and deployed as a full-stack application with a modern UI. The frontend is written in React (TypeScript), and the backend is powered by Flask, with Firebase managing the records (Wins/Losses/Draws).

## Features

- Play Connect4 against an AI model
- Modern and responsive user interface
